Evaluating risk orders with Agent1...
[Agent1 Evaluation]
The risk orders do not match the intended structure. 

In the input_first orders, the related modules do not follow directly. For example, in the first order, "CompanyServiceTest" should not follow "Company" directly. 

In the relation_first orders, the related modules are appended but not logical. For example, in the first order, "Jwt" should not follow "Company" directly.
Agent1 rejected risk orders. Looping back with updated prompts.

The second order "input_first_temp0.7_top0.9" is not following the intended structure. The related modules are not following directly. AuthenticationService should come before Authorization and Scope. Similarly, RefreshToken should come after UserService.

Evaluating risk orders with Agent1...
[Agent1 Evaluation]
The orders do not match the intended structure. 

In the input_first orders, related modules do not follow directly. For example, in the first order, "Jwt" and "Authorization" are not directly followed by their related modules.

In the relation_first orders, related modules are not logically appended. For example, in the first order, "Jwt" is not followed by its related modules in a logical manner.

Evaluating risk orders with Agent1...
[Agent1 Evaluation]
The third input_first order is incorrect because the Jwt module does not follow directly after the Client module. Instead, AuthenticationService and AuthorizationService come in between. 

The first relation_first order is incorrect because ClientService does not logically follow AuthenticationService and AuthorizationService. 

The third relation_first order is incorrect because Client does not logically follow Scope. Also, UserService does not logically follow RedirectUri.

The orders do not match the intended structure. In the input_first orders, related modules do not follow directly.
