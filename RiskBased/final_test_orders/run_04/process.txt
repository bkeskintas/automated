The following orders do not match the intended structure:

1. relation_first_temp0.7_top0.9: The module 'Authentication' should be 'AuthenticationService' to maintain consistency with the other orders.
2. relation_first_temp1.0_top0.85: The module 'AuthorizationService' should be 'Authorization' to maintain consistency with the other orders.

The following orders do not match the intended structure:

input_first_temp0.7_top0.9: Company > Client > Jwt > Scope > RedirectUri > Authorization > RefreshToken > Authentication > User
- The related modules do not follow directly. For example, Jwt should be followed by AuthenticationService and AuthorizationService, but it is followed by Scope.

input_first_temp1.0_top0.85: Company > Client > RedirectUri > Jwt > AuthenticationService > Authorization > RefreshToken > Scope > UserService
- The related modules do not follow directly. For example, Jwt should be followed by AuthenticationService and AuthorizationService, but it is followed by AuthenticationService and Authorization.

relation_first_temp0.3_top1.0: Company > Jwt > Scope > Client > Authorization > RedirectUri > RefreshToken > AuthenticationService > UserService
- The related modules are not appended logically. For example, Jwt should be followed by AuthenticationService and AuthorizationService, but it is followed by Scope.

relation_first_temp0.7_top0.9: Company > Jwt > Scope > Client > AuthenticationService > AuthorizationService > UserService > RedirectUri > RefreshToken > AuthorizationCode
- The related modules are not appended logically. For example, Jwt should be followed by AuthenticationService and AuthorizationService, but it is followed by Scope.

relation_first_temp1.0_top0.85: Company > Jwt > Scope > AuthenticationService > AuthorizationService > ClientService > UserService > RefreshTokenService > RedirectUriService
- The related modules are not appended logically. For example, Jwt should be followed by AuthenticationService and AuthorizationService, but it is followed by Scope.

The orders do not match the intended structure. 

In the input_first orders, related modules do not follow directly. For example, in the first order, "Jwt" should be followed by "Authorization", but it is followed by "Client". 

In the relation_first orders, related modules are not logically appended. For example, in the first order, "Jwt" should be followed by "Authorization", but it is followed by "Scope".

The third input_first order does not follow the intended structure. The related modules do not follow directly. The module 'RedirectUri' should be placed after 'UserService'. 

The second relation_first order does not follow the intended structure. The module 'User' should be 'UserService' to maintain logical consistency.

The first three orders are not valid. In the input_first structure, related modules must follow directly, but in these orders, they don't. For example, in the first order, "RedirectUri" should follow "Client" directly, but "Jwt" is in between. Similarly, in the second order, "Jwt" should follow "Client" directly, but "Authorization" is in between. In the third order, "AuthenticationService" should follow "Client" directly, but "Jwt" is in between.

The last three orders are also not valid. In the relation_first structure, related modules should be appended but logical. However, in these orders, the modules are not logically related. For example, in the fourth order, "Jwt" should not follow "Company" directly as they are not logically related. Similarly, in the fifth order, "Jwt" should not follow "Company" directly. In the sixth order, "Jwt" should not follow "Company" directly, and the "RepositoryIntegrationTest" modules are not logically related to the preceding modules.
